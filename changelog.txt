VERSION 9
Special thanks to DevAnj2 for many of the new features in this version.

- Added a balanced mode which makes monster drops scale based on original values.
- Made three money candles, one in Arena, one in the eastern Underground Reservoir, and one in the Dance Hall, count as item locations by the randomizer.
- Added statfix and wizard modes. Statfix fixes the INT and LCK stats, making bullet souls scale with INT and having LCK actually have a notable effect on drops. Wizard mode raises overall MP regen.
- Redid how item ranking is done to give more weight to stats.
- Added Guncula, Fistula and Assassin game modes. Guncula only has guns placed as weapons, Fistula does the same with fist weapons, and Assassin with knives and katanas.
- Added Newbie mode, where the whole map is revealed and peeping eye effect is on all the time.
- Minor changes to Chaos mode logic
- Dracula souls can now be specified in custom mode
- v9.2
	- Fixed errors in weapon game modes.
	- Added "intboost" mode which increases int bonuses on various equips.


VERSION 8
- Due to an error, the Headhunter fix mentioned in version 7 did not work, but now it does.

VERSION 7
- Added support for custom seeds, including some examples.
	- "custom_example.txt" is a devilish challenge of my design.
	- "custom_early_bat.txt" just puts Giant Bat where Grave Keeper would be.
	- The "vanilla" files can be used to keep items in their usual locations.
	- See "custom_template.txt" for information on how to make your own.
- Randomized the three souls required to get the good ending. See Ancient Books for hints.
- Updated item routing logic (mostly Chaos mode but some normal stuff too).
- Cracked down on Chaos mode routing to resist potential sequence breaking.
- Previously it was possible to get stuck in Headhunter's area; this should no longer be the case (unless playing a custom seed).
- Various bugfixes and balance tweaks.

VERSION 6
- "Chaos Mode" added. "Chaos Mode" is the hard version of the randomizer, not to confused with Aria of Sorrow's "hard mode". To play Chaos Mode, type "chaos" when the randomizer asks for flags.
- Hammer's inventory is now randomizable.
- On both Chaos and casual modes, Legion and Balore will drop certain progression souls in order to prevent softlocks.
- General balance changes. The normal mode was made more random (easier) now that Chaos Mode is available.
- Previously, many item locations were not considered for important souls. Now, there's a chance a progression soul will be at nearly any location in the game.
- Added some more special surprises and secret codes.
- The randomizer now works on the Japanese version of the rom.
- On the English version, you can now see your seed and flags in the menu.
